# README: Large Language Models and Related Techniques

## **Overview**
This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for a variety of tasks, including setup, embedding generation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and advanced applications in error analysis. By leveraging open-source tools like Hugging Face libraries and Llama Index, this project aims to understand the strengths and limitations of LLMs and enhance their capabilities with additional context and techniques.

## **Project Structure**
### **Part 1: LLM Setup, Prompting, and Embedding Generation**
#### **Objectives**:
1. Set up open-source LLMs using the Hugging Face library on Google Colab or a local machine.
2. Generate prompts and query the LLM for meaningful responses.
3. Create embeddings for semantically similar and dissimilar contexts using embedding encoders.

---

### **Part 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
#### **Objectives**:
1. Build a local RAG system using Hugging Face and Llama Index libraries.
2. Store domain-specific documents in a vector-indexed database for context retrieval.
3. Query the LLM with domain-specific questions and analyze the improvement in accuracy and robustness.

### **Part 3: NVIDIA XID Error Classification and Explanation**
#### **Objectives**:
1. Use LLMs to explain and classify XID errors into categories.
2. Identify relationships between XID errors to build a PGM for error diagnosis.
3. Evaluate the impact of RAG and advanced prompting techniques on LLM performance.
